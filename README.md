 Project explanation:
      I made two features in my final project, one of them is comment feature another one is real-time push notification.
  For notification, I download a plugin then modified some code so notifications can show after user take any action such 
  like delete, add answer, etc. Comment feature and answer feature are somewhat similar, however I think comment feature is much more
  difficult because it has complex relationship with other parameter, So I have to modified view pages, models, routes, etc which we made before.
  
  
  User stories:
  
  1.As a user, I would never makes mistakes because everytime I will receive notifications when I make changes on website.
   
  2.As a user I want search a answer of a specified question, And I can comment this answer whether or not it resolved the question.
  
  3.Teacher could put exam exercises on this site website, students who already solved this question can upload their answer, and write
  their own solution on comment to help others who can not figure this question out.
  
  4.Teachers can put questions on website and students can answer these questions online, teacher can grade these answers online and
  make comments on.
